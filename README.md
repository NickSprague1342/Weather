# Nicks Weather Dashboard

## Description

```
This is a basic weather app that users can utilize to search for weather data by location. I used Vue.JS for some parts of the application because many of the developers that I work with at my full-time job use Vue and I wanted to give it a try.
```

## Technologies Used

```
HTML used for the structure.
CSS used for styling.
JavaScript used for functionality.
Vue used for functionality.
```

## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```

## Issues

```
Unfortunately, the app does not work as expected. I have chosen to submit what I have to keep from falling too far behind. My intent is to work on it more in the coming weeks.
